I have used [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/) for blogging and hosting. After a few month of using it, I decided to migrate my personal blog to Jekyll and host it using Github pages. There are several reasons behind that:

* Wordpress page takes a while to load.
* Wordpress.com is charged.
* Writing Markdown is essentially easier for me, as a programmer.
* There are more restrictions on Wordpress than on Jekyll, or, it takes more effort to work around Wordpress than with Jekyll.

As a programmer, these reasons were sufficient for such a decision. I picked the popular theme [hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) as my basic theme, and customized the style a little bit.

And here it is! <i class="em em-lq"></i>
