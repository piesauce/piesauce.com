<blockquote class="full-width"><p> Software Engineer (Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing) </p></blockquote>

Hello!
I am Suhas Pai, oft referred to on the internets by my online moniker ‘piesauce’.

I am passionate about harnessing natural language processing technologies to help people understand each other better, as well as researching new techniques to facilitate it. My key research interests lie in privacy-preserving NLP, controlled text generation, and natural language understanding. More information about my work in NLP can be found on my [Projects](https://www.piesauce.com/projects/) page. 

I am also fascinated by machine learning in general and am particularly interested in understanding and developing neural network architectures that embody effective inductive biases. I also possess a keen interest in the ethical aspects of developing and deploying AI systems, like privacy, interpretability, and bias.


### Personal History 

I was born and spent most of my childhood in the southern part of Coastal Karnataka, a state in the Indian southwest. I immigrated to the Netherlands and graduated with a Masters degree in Computer Science from Eindhoven University of Technology, where I was first exposed to machine learning and natural language processing. I did my Masters thesis at IBM Security on designing and implementing rule-based and machine learning techniques for automatic classification of enterprise data based on its security levels. Post graduation, I worked as a staff software engineer at IBM Netherlands from 2013-2017, responsible for developing and shipping enterprise security administration and auditing products. While I loved my job and my team, I realized that my true passion lay in natural language processing and decided to go back to my roots. Thereafter, I immigrated to Canada to be part of the AI revolution.

I currently live in Toronto, which I think is the greatest city in the world. I previously lived in Amsterdam, which I thought back then was the greatest city in the world. Before that, I lived in Delft, NL, which I also thought was the greatest city in the world. Yes, I am a hopeless romantic when it comes to cities. 

### ML community involvement

### Hobbies.
In due course, I will fill this site up with more content about my hobbies. 
I love to read, walk, eat, and write, not necessarily in that order. I nerd out on public transit, aviation, board games, and election predictions. I am passionate about immigration and public transportation advocacy.
