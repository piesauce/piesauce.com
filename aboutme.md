<blockquote class="full-width"><p> Software Engineer (Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing) </p></blockquote>

Hello!
I am Suhas Pai, oft referred to on the internets by my online moniker ‘piesauce’

I am passionate about harnessing natural language processing technologies to help people understand each other better, as well as researching new techniques to facilitate it. My key NLP research interests lie in representation learning, language modeling, and natural language understanding. More information about my work in NLP can be found on my Projects page. 

I am also fascinated by machine learning in general and am particularly interested in understanding and developing neural network architectures that embody effective inductive biases. I also possess a keen interest in the ethical aspects of developing and deploying AI systems, like privacy, interpretability, and prejudice.

I write blogs on NLP discussing papers that interest me.
For long-form blogs summarizing the latest NLP conference proceedings:
For blogs summarizing the papers whose results I replicated: 

This year, I embarked on a project to read and blog about every paper in the reference list of Graham Neubig’s Neural Nets for NLP course. You can find those blogs here:


I was born and spent my childhood in India, completed my higher education and spent the initial 5 years of my career in The Netherlands, and now live in Canada. I consider myself to be a mosaic of these three national cultures and the various urban cultures that have shaped me.

I currently live in Toronto, which I think is the greatest city in the world. I previously lived in Amsterdam, which I thought back then was the greatest city in the world. Before that, I lived in Delft, NL, which I also thought was the greatest city in the world. Yes, I am a hopeless romantic when it comes to cities. 
I am currently writing a book about my urban experience. The book is part-travelogue, part-autobiography, part-data based prescriptions, part-cultural critique. I hope to finish it by the end of this year and therefore have publicly posted this on my website to remind myself!

### History
In a previous life, I worked in the field of information security at IBM Netherlands for around 5 years. Before that, I completed my Masters degree in Computer Science at Eindhoven University of Technology, with my thesis on using machine learning techniques to automatically classify data based on their security levels.

### Hobbies.
In due course, I will fill this site up with more content about my hobbies. 
I love to read, walk, eat, and write, not necessarily in that order. I nerd out on public transit, aviation, board games, and election predictions. I love developing travel plans and itineraries for my friends.
